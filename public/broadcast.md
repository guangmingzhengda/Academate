# The poem of Sakura

Spiraling lights, beaming through the seams.
A gust of wind plays the tune, a start of the Etude.
O Sakura tree, start your symphony.
The wind bathes her spring flowers light.
Believe in her power, let faith take control.
There is no need to be scared.
Stand firm, here in our world, the Sakura tree dances.
Will our voices reach you?
A poem that transcends the limits of this world.
Putting down this brush, reach them!
Beyond my limits...
